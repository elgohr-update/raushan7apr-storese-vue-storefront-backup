# Vue Storefront - headless PWA for any eCommerce

Vue Storefront is a standalone PWA storefront for your eCommerce, possible to connect with any eCommerce backend (eg. Magento, <a href="https://github.com/DivanteLtd/coreshop-vsbridge">Pimcore/CoreShop</a>, [BigCommerce](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/bigcommerce2vuestorefront), Prestashop or Shopware) through the API.

Vue Storefront is and always will be in the open source. Anyone can use and support the project, we want it to be a tool for the improvement of the shopping experience.
The project is in the **production ready** phase.

See the ideas behind Vue Storefront [here](https://www.slideshare.net/FilipRakowski/vue-storefront-basics

PS: Check [StorefrontUI](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/storefront-ui/) - our UI library for eCommerce.

1. "master" is the prod release branch

    (Ex: master -> default-theme-master), <br>
